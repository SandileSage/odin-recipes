# odin-recipes
First Odin-Project project

This project required me to build a basic recipe website with all the knowledge I have aquired from TOP so far. To complete the project I have learnt and used the following:
- HTML (elements, tags, boilerplate, text, lists, links & images)
- Git & GitHub
- VSCode
- CLI
